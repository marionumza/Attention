    <h1> Sale Quotation Btns
        <p>
            Adds view buttons to view sale orders without downloading them
            as pdf files. Also adds HTML view for a good presentation.<br/>
        <p>
            <b>NB:</b> In version 12.0 there is already a nice builtin preview
            button so this is not quite necessary.
            Anyway, ported it for anyone interested.
